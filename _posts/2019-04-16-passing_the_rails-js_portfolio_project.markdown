So today i passed my Rails-JS portfolio project. It was much more relaxed and it always helps the interviewer if we are vocal about what we're doing rather than just starting to type or frantically looking for files.
The procedure is straightforward. The person assigned to do your project review first checks if you have satisfied all the requirements(listed 1-5 on the project page). Then there is a live coding session and lastly general javascript fundamentals round.
I think this review helped me a lot to look closely at where I am and my understanding of the course material. It helped me get insight into what more I need to get done in order to be more effective communicator and practice needed to crack that coding interview when I do get a job. So moving onto React/React. Few more weeks to go. It has been an amazing journey so far. Thank you Flatiron community.
