For my sinatra project, I decided to do a grocery list app.
The gorcery list has a name, item list. And the user has name, password. I used the password protection from "bcrypt" gem that helps to store the password in encrypted form. And its decrypted when trying to authenticate a user.
The user has to sign up in the beginning. Then can create a new grocery list for each store that he/she needs to visit. The user can add or delete item to/from the list. All CRUD operations can be performed on the grocery list.
In future, I wish to add and ItemList class that can contain all the items in the grocery list with its quantity and price. The DB can contain the grocery items that are most frequently bought like milk, eggs, bread etc.
