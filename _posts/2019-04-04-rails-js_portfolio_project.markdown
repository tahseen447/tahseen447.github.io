Today I started working on my rails-js portfolio project. First of all a little update. Since the last time i wrote a blog post or created the rails project, I got a new MAC book pro. Now, I have been a windows person but i will tell you this " I AM IN LOVE WITH MAC OS". And learn curriculum updated to rails 5.something and ruby 2.6 beyond.
So coming back to the point, I had to update some gems in my gem file, especially the webdrivers originally chrom web drivers?. And update ruby too. 
Before that a very imported note: Please add 'gem 'jquery-rails' to the gem file else jquery will not work. Also, after adding jquery to gem file you will also have to add it to the js manifest file under app/assets. I started by installing another gem which is the active_model_serializer. This was relatively easy. The requirements are kind of straightforward but need some more clarity.
