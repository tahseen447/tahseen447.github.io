Today I started working on my rails-js portfolio project. First of all a little update. Since the last time i wrote a blog post or created the rails project, I got a new MAC book pro. Now, I have been a windows person but i will tell you this " I AM IN LOVE WITH MAC OS". And learn curriculum updated to rails 5.something and ruby 2.6 beyond.
So coming back to the point, I had to update some gems in my gem file, especially the webdrivers originally chrom web drivers?. And update ruby too. 
Before that a very imported note: Please add 'gem 'jquery-rails' to the gem file else jquery will not work. Also, after adding jquery to gem file you will also have to add it to the js manifest file under app/assets.  DISCLAIMER: The order in which you add to the js manifest also matters so be mindful. Quick tips: be wary of any coffee scripts that might have been added to your project when you created it initially.  This might prevent your actual js file to be loaded in the app.
I started by installing another gem which is the active_model_serializer. This was relatively easy. The requirements are kind of straightforward but need some more clarity. 
After talking today to my project lead [Dalia Sawaya](https://learn-co.slack.com/team/U50C90FH7), I now have more clarity going into the next steps.
All in all its a blessed friday! My kids were on top of their game too. I got to eat breakfast on time, joined the project support study group and squeezed in a workout. All in one day and its not even noon. Yay!
