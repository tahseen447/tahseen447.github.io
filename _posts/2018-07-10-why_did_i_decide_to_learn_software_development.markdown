Isn't it obvious?
The world is moving past and you have to learn to write some code. I chose Information Systems as my major in my undergraduate and just enjoyed learning the intricacies of how software is made. Software development is intersting and follows major protocols which have been refined over few decades to make lives of software programmers and developers easier. I like the fact how every living entity can be transformed to a programming object and attributes and functions can be performed on each of them
